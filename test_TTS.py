text = "Oh, I absolutely loved 'Parasite'! It's such a brilliantly crafted film that expertly blends dark comedy, drama, and satire. The storytelling is incredibly engaging and the social commentary is thought-provoking. The performances are outstanding, especially Song Kang-ho's portrayal of the father character. The cinematography and direction by Bong Joon-ho are top-notch. Overall, 'Parasite' is a masterpiece that deserved all the accolades it received, including the Academy Award for Best Picture. Have you seen it?"
